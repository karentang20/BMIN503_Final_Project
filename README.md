# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

Overview
The project is to analyze the correlation between diabetes and several social determinants, including race, income, insurance, and clinical distance. The goal is to understand how these factors influence the prevalence and management of diabetes, providing insights that can inform public strategies, healthcare policies, and intervention programs.

Data I used are the following:

1.Diabetes = BRFSS dataset in 2022, the dataset is uploaded to this repository under the name of "ExportCSV.csv"
2. Social determinants = the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Social Determinants of Health Database, the data I used is the Census Tract of 2020. Since the file is too big to upload here, I filtered the datset by only Pennsylvania and West Virginia and export it as a csv file. The dataset is uploaded to this repository under the name of "PA_WV_social"
