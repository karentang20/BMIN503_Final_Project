# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

Overview
The project is to analyze the role of social determinants in diabetes prevalence and managment. The social determinants will be explore in this project are race, income, insurance coverage, and clinic proximity. The goal is to understand how these factors influence the prevalence and management of diabetes, providing insights that can inform public strategies, healthcare policies, and intervention programs.

Data I used are the following:

1.Diabetes = the dataset is uploaded to this repository under the name of "ExportCSV.csv", it is state level survey data of the year 2022 from the Behavioral Risk Surveillance System (BRFSS). 
2. Social determinants = the dataset is a county level data of Census Tract 2020 from the Social Determinants of Health Database. Since the file is too big to upload here, I filtered the datset by only Pennsylvania and West Virginia and export it as a csv file. The dataset is uploaded to this repository under the name of "PA_WV_social"
3. Geospatial Data from the tigris package in Rstudio.
